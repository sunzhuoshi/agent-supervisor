# Default Agent

The Semantic Commit Agent automates pull request creation using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for clear, actionable commit messages.  
It analyzes code changes to determine the appropriate message type (feat, fix, chore, etc.) and scope.  
PR descriptions are enriched with summaries and changelog updates, helping reviewers quickly understand impact and purpose.

**Features:**
- Auto-detects commit type and scope
- Enforces semantic commit standards
- Enriches PR body with changelog and context
- Supports better release and changelog workflows
