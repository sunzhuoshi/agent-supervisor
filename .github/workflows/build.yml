# Concurrency configuration:
# - For pull requests: Each PR gets its own group (using PR number), allowing multiple PRs to run in parallel
# - For branch pushes: Uses the branch ref, ensuring only one build runs per branch at a time
# - cancel-in-progress: Cancels old runs when new commits are pushed to the same PR or branch
